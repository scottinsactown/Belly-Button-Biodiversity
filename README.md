A 2012 study discovered 2,368 different species (operational taxonomic units or OTUs) in 60 navels. Each subjectâ€™s belly button hosted about 67 different OTUs. No OTU was common to every person, and only eight were found on at least 70 percent of participants. If one of those eight was found in a belly button, there was usually a lot of that species. Explore the study results using the interactive dashboard components.
